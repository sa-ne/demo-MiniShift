## MiniShift Demo WalkThru

### Requirements:
* See Installation doc for requirements

### WalkThru:
There are two scenarios for this demo:
* Individual Exercises Demo -- let's you pick and choose which exercises to demo, allowing for customization
* Full Demo -- this runs through all exercises but in a more condensed format.  It can be used to conduct a roughly two-hour hands-on lab as well.

Refer to scenario-specific WalkThru documents for details.
